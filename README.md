# 2D in 3D Puzzle Platformer
This is a project where I attempt to recreate the mechanic of The Pedestrian from Skookum Arts.
A puzzle platformer available on Steam that has very interesting gameplay, I strongly recommend playing it:

I try to implement the main gameplay mechanic from scratch and later on create a level editor as well for others to play around with it.
This being part of my portfolio I don't intend to go further than finish the core loop and later on the level editor.
